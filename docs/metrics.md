# Metric Definitions

- **Total Pay**: Calculated as `Base Salary + OT Hours * (Base Salary / Regular Hours * 1.5)`. (Note: This is an approximation; actual `regular_gross_paid` + `total_ot_paid` + `total_other_pay` is safer).
- **Overtime Pay**: Represented by `total_ot_paid`.
- **Base Salary**: The annual or hourly rate before overtime.
- **Agency**: The department or office (e.g., 'ADMIN FOR CHILDREN'S SVCS').
